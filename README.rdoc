This work was a practice just for learning Rails.
Thanks a lot to this website :

I tried my best to make this web application look perfectly.
After doing this small project, I gradually realized that I still have a lot things to learn,
like the front-end design, and so on.
Overall, it's such a good feeling make this stuff out!
